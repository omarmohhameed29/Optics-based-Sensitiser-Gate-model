# Optics-based-Sensitiser-Gate-model
Use optics to control sesitizer gate model
Components:
-Arduino
-Buzzer
-LDR
-light source
-servo motor
-mirrors

Project description:
Light source produces light which reflects thriugh each
Miror to cover the whole gate and recieved finally 
With LDR, so when person passes thriugh the gate,
Light is cut, so LDR reading changes, order servo motor
To grab the pump so sanitizer liquid goes out on the 
Person
