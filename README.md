# Optics-based-Sensitizer-Gate-model
Use optics to control sesitizer gate model
Components:
-Arduino
-Buzzer
-LDR
-light source
-servo motor
-mirrors

Project description:
Light source produces light which reflects through each Miror to cover the whole gate and received finally With LDR, so when person passes through the gate, Light is cut, so LDR reading changes, order servo motor to grab the pump so sanitizer liquid goes out on the Person.
